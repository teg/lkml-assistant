# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build/Lint/Test Commands
- Build: `make build`
- Lint: `make lint`
- Test (all): `make test`
- Test (single): `make test TEST=test_name.py`
- Format code: `make fmt`

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Autoformat code before committing with `make fmt`
- Run and pass all tests locally with `make test` before committing
- Use static type checking where available
- Follow test-driven development when appropriate
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Minimize dependencies between components
- Document all public APIs and complex logic

### Git Workflow
- Split tasks into small, logically consistent commits
- Each commit should focus on a specific change or feature
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain:
  - What was done (briefly)
  - Why it was done (focus on this)
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in a single commit
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable

### Dependency Management
- When introducing a new framework or library:
  - Document what it is and its purpose
  - Explain why it was chosen over alternatives
  - Add details to relevant documentation
- Keep dependencies up-to-date but stable
- Pin dependency versions to ensure reproducible builds

### Testing Requirements
- All new code should include appropriate tests:
  - Unit tests for isolated functionality
  - Integration tests for components that interact
- Tests must be runnable locally with `make test`
- All tests must be integrated into GitHub Actions CI
- Aim for good test coverage of critical paths

### Code Review
- Review for clarity, correctness, and consistency
- Look for potential security issues
- Verify error handling and edge cases
- Ensure new dependencies are justified and appropriate
- Check that tests adequately cover new functionality

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow Linux kernel coding style for C/C++ code
- PEP 8 for Python code
- TypeScript standard guidelines for CDK code
- Use type annotations in Python and TypeScript
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Import order: standard library, third-party, local
- Function/method names: snake_case
- Class names: CamelCase
- Constants: UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
- Error handling: prefer early returns, use appropriate error codes
- Include descriptive docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Write unit tests for all new functionality

## Code Formatting and Linting Tools

To ensure consistency in the codebase, use these formatter and linter configurations:

### Python

- **Formatter**: Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) with default settings
  - Command: `black src tests`
  - Already integrated in `make fmt`

- **Linter**: Use [Flake8](https://flake8.readthedocs.io/) with the following configuration:
  - Max line length: 100
  - Ignore: E203 (whitespace before ':'), W503 (line break before binary operator), E501 (line too long)
  - Command: `flake8 --exclude="*/python/*,*/vendored/*,*/.venv/*" src tests`
  - Already integrated in `make fmt`

### TypeScript

- **Formatter**: Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) with default settings
  - Command: `npm run format` (in the infra directory)
  - Already integrated in `make fmt`

- **Linter**: Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with the TypeScript plugin
  - Configuration file: `/infra/.eslintrc.js`
  - Command: `npm run lint` (in the infra directory)
  - Already integrated in `make fmt`

### Autoformatting Approach

This project relies on autoformatting rather than linting to maintain consistent code style:

1. For **Python**:
   - **Black** is used as the sole formatter
   - Configuration is in `pyproject.toml` with a line length of 100 characters
   - No linters are used to avoid conflicts with Black's formatting decisions
   
2. For **TypeScript**:
   - **Prettier** is used as the sole formatter
   - Configuration is in `.prettierrc` with consistent settings
   - No separate linting is performed

### Git Pre-commit Hooks

The repository has git pre-commit hooks that automatically format code before each commit. The hook will:

1. Format all Python code with Black
2. Format all TypeScript code with Prettier
3. Fail the commit if changes were made during formatting

To bypass these checks in exceptional cases, use:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Commit message"
```

## Project Organization
- Source code in `src/` directory
- Tests in `tests/` directory
- Documentation in `docs/` directory
- Infrastructure as code in `infra/` directory

## Architecture

For detailed architecture documentation, see [Architecture Documentation](./docs/architecture/).

- **Backend**: AWS CDK (TypeScript), Python 3.9 Lambda functions, DynamoDB, EventBridge
- **Data Flow**:
  1. Lambda functions fetch data from Patchwork API and lore.kernel.org
  2. Data is processed, correlated, and stored in DynamoDB
  3. EventBridge schedules regular data fetching and processing

### Core Architecture Components

- [Architecture Overview](./docs/architecture/overview.md): System diagrams and high-level design
- [Backend Architecture](./docs/architecture/backend.md): Detailed AWS services and code organization
- [Data Models](./docs/architecture/data-models.md): Domain and database models
- [Design Patterns](./docs/architecture/design-patterns.md): Key patterns used in the application

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Serverless First**: Utilizing AWS managed services to minimize operational overhead
2. **Event-Driven Design**: Using events for loose coupling between components
3. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data access through clean interfaces
4. **Single-Table Design**: Optimizing DynamoDB access patterns
5. **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined through AWS CDK
6. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Using retry mechanisms and dead letter queues
