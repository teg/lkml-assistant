# 2. Implement Repository Pattern

Date: 2023-05-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The LKML Assistant application needs to interact with our DynamoDB datastore from multiple Lambda functions and potentially other services in the future. We need to decide on a pattern for data access that will:

1. Provide a consistent interface for data operations across the codebase
2. Abstract away the complexities of DynamoDB operations including single-table design
3. Enable testability by allowing for dependency injection
4. Support our evolving data access patterns
5. Allow for potential future changes to the underlying data store
6. Reduce code duplication and encourage reuse

Currently, direct DynamoDB SDK calls are scattered throughout the codebase, making the code harder to test and maintain. As the application grows, this approach will lead to inconsistent data access patterns and increased complexity.

## Decision

We will implement the Repository Pattern to abstract data access logic from business logic. Specifically:

1. Create dedicated repository classes for each domain entity (e.g., `DiscussionRepository`, `PatchRepository`)
2. Each repository will expose a consistent interface of methods matching domain operations rather than database operations
3. DynamoDB access details will be encapsulated within the repository implementations
4. Repositories will be injectable dependencies to enable testing with mocks
5. Common DynamoDB operations will be abstracted into utility functions where appropriate

Sample repository interface:
```python
class DiscussionRepository:
    def get_by_id(self, discussion_id: str) -> Discussion:
        """Get a discussion by its ID"""
        pass

    def save(self, discussion: Discussion) -> None:
        """Save a discussion entity"""
        pass

    def query_by_date_range(self, start_date: datetime, end_date: datetime) -> List[Discussion]:
        """Get discussions within a date range"""
        pass
        
    def get_recent_discussions(self, limit: int = 20) -> List[Discussion]:
        """Get most recent discussions"""
        pass
```

Implementation will use DynamoDB-specific code within the repository class but expose a clean, domain-focused interface.

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Business logic functions become cleaner and more focused on domain operations
2. Testing becomes easier through dependency injection of repository mocks
3. DynamoDB query complexity is hidden behind simple method calls
4. Consistent data access patterns across the codebase
5. Future changes to the underlying data store implementation only require changes to repository classes
6. Reduces learning curve for new developers who don't need to understand DynamoDB details
7. Type safety through clear interfaces and return types

### Negative
1. Adds extra abstraction layer which may seem like overhead for simple operations
2. Requires more upfront design and implementation time
3. Developers need to understand and follow the pattern consistently
4. May lead to larger repository classes that need to be split as patterns evolve
5. Potential for performance overhead if not implemented carefully

### Mitigations
1. Provide clear documentation and examples of repository usage
2. Create base repository classes/utilities to reduce boilerplate
3. Include repository pattern in code reviews as a key architectural requirement
4. Use composition to break up complex repositories as needed
5. Implement performance testing to ensure abstractions don't create bottlenecks
6. Start with the most common operations and expand repositories iteratively
