# Implementation Roadmap

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the implementation phases for the LKML Community Guide project.

For more information about specific phases, see:

- [Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure](./phase1.md)
- [Phase 2: Data Processing & Web Dashboard Foundation](./phase2.md)
- [Phase 3: Web Dashboard Implementation](./phase3.md)
- [Phase 4: Production Deployment and Refinement](./phase4.md)

## Overview of Implementation Phases

The implementation of the LKML Community Guide is divided into four major phases:

### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Create the foundation of the system including the AWS infrastructure, data models, data access layer, and basic automation.

**Key Components**:
- AWS CDK infrastructure setup
- DynamoDB data models and repositories
- Lambda functions for data fetching
- EventBridge scheduling
- Deployment automation
- Testing framework

**Status**: âœ… Completed

### Phase 2: Data Processing & Web Dashboard Foundation

**Purpose**: Implement the business logic for processing and analyzing the fetched data, and establish the foundations for the web dashboard interface.

**Key Components**:
- Patch status tracking and analysis
- Discussion threading and correlation
- Content analysis and summarization
- API layer for dashboard data access
- DynamoDB optimization for web interface
- Event-driven processing enhancements
- Notification system implementation

**Status**: ðŸ”„ In Planning

### Phase 3: Web Dashboard Implementation

**Purpose**: Create a comprehensive web dashboard interface for visualizing and interacting with the patch and discussion data.

**Key Components**:
- AWS Amplify infrastructure setup
- React application foundation
- Authentication and user management
- Dashboard layouts and navigation
- Patch and discussion visualization interfaces
- Data visualization components
- Advanced user experience features
- Integration testing and optimization

**Status**: ðŸ”„ Pending

### Phase 4: Production Deployment and Refinement

**Purpose**: Finalize the integration between all system components, implement advanced features, secure the application, and prepare for production deployment.

**Key Components**:
- API integration and optimization
- Advanced backend features
- Security hardening
- Multi-environment deployment strategy
- Monitoring and observability
- Performance optimization
- Disaster recovery and high availability
- Documentation and knowledge base
- Production launch and support

**Status**: ðŸ”„ Pending

## Implementation Schedule

The project follows an iterative development approach with each phase building on the previous one. The high-level timeline is:

| Phase | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure | 6 weeks | âœ… Completed |
| Phase 2: Data Processing & Web Dashboard Foundation | 8 weeks | ðŸ”„ In Planning |
| Phase 3: Web Dashboard Implementation | 8 weeks | ðŸ”„ Pending |
| Phase 4: Production Deployment and Refinement | 6 weeks | ðŸ”„ Pending |

## Development Approach

Our development approach emphasizes:

1. **Iterative Development**: Each phase builds incrementally on previous work
2. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment for all components
3. **DevOps Practices**: Infrastructure as code, CI/CD, monitoring and observability
4. **User-Centered Design**: Focus on creating an intuitive web dashboard experience
5. **Scalability**: Building for future growth in both users and communities covered
6. **Data Quality**: Ensuring accuracy and reliability of the insights provided
7. **Security First**: Implementing security best practices throughout
